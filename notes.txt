Notes on creating a guitar effects pedal from R-Pi

Starting jack:

    jackd -d alsa -d hw:CARD=S3,DEV=0


Experiments with Carla
======================

    sudo apt-get install liblo-dev libasound2-dev
    git clone https://github.com/falkTX/Carla.git

Added:
    sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsvg pyqt5-dev-tools

Changed BASE_OPTS in source/Makefile.mk like:

    -BASE_OPTS  = -O3 -ffast-math -mtune=generic -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections
    +BASE_OPTS  = -O3 -ffast-math -mtuneN=cortex-a53 -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections

(basically change -mtune from generic to cortex-a53 [the pi's chip] and
removed the sse stuff that gcc doesn't recognize)


    make PREFIX=$HOME/.local
    make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install


Run this to run in headless mode:

    ~/.local/bin/carla -n


port 22752


Setting up R-Pi
===============

Got latest raspbian (Raspberry Pi OS, now).  Unzip and mount the image with
read-write, touch an "ssh" file in the root directory to enable ssh.

Do:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/adafruit-pitft.sh
    chmod +x adafruit-pitft.sh
    sudo ./adafruit-pitft.sh

Change the password:
    passwd
    [enter new password]

Copy your ssh key to ~pi/.ssh/authorized_keys

Set window manager to ratpoison:

    sudo apt-get install ratpoison

    sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
    [select /usr/bin/ratpoison]

    $ echo exec ratpoison > ~/.xsession
    $ chmod 755 ~/.xsession
    $ echo

Fix the touchscreen driver if it's broken:

-   Get the source from https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-5.4.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/pitft28-resistive-overlay.dts
-   Rebuild:

    $ dtc -I dts -O dtb pitft28-resistive-overlay.dts -o pitft28-resistive.dtbo
    $ sudo mv /boot/overlayfs/pitft28-resistive.dtbo \
        /boot/overlayfs/pitft28-resistive.dtbo.org
    $ sudo cp pitft28-resistive.dtbo /boot/overlayfs/pitft28-resistive.dtbo
-   Reboot.

Uninstall piwiz (the install program):

    $ sudo apt-get remove piwiz

Install x11-xserver-utils (for xrdb):

    $ sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils

Setting up guitarix/rakarrack and Calf Plugins
==============================================

    $ apt-get install guitarix calf-plugins rakarrack

Don't actually install rakarrack, see my notes below under "setting up my
code".

To get the user bank to come up as default, you must change the
~/.fltk/github.com.Stazed.rakarrack.plus/rakarrack-plus.prefs file's "Bank
Filename" parameter to the location of your user bank. (Note, I had to create
this file myself, it didn't exist prior to that)

Notes on Guitarix
-----------------

-   Stereo effects go after the second amp block, mono effects before it.
-   Wah works better before Fuzz.

Installing mod-host
-------------------

    $ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev liblilv-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host.git
    $ cd mod-host
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Setting up my code
==================

    # apt-get install swig libasound2-dev a2jmidid tmux lingot
    # python setup.py install
    # python3 -m pip install cffi
    # python3 -m pip install NumPy
    # python3 -m pip install JACK-Client
    # pip3 install attrs

    For rak+:
    $ apt-get install libxpm-dev libfltk1.3-dev libjack-jackd2-dev \
      libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0-dev libasound2-dev libxft-dev \
      libfftw3-dev lv2-dev
    $ git clone ssh://192.168.1.11/home/mmuller/w2/rakarrack-plus
mkdir build, cd build, cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .., make -j4

    Configure lingot to run on jack on a server, then copy
    ~/.lingot/lingot.conf to the pi.

Note that we install rakarrack-plus into #`/usr`# instead of #`/usr/local`#.
This is because lilv seems to want to use #`/usr/lib/lv2`# for plugins when
installed from the distro, and we want the rakarrack-plus plugins to be
visible to lilv so they can be used from mod-host.

Add this line to /etc/rc.local:

    su pi -c tmux new -ds pidal /home/pi/run.sh

Where to go Next
================

-   Get to where we can configure a graph of plugins on mod-host by pushing a
    json object to the HTTP server.
-   Exiting from the list menu doesn't seem to leave the buttons in a good
    state.
-   Restore of configs doesn't work (switches are out of sync with actual
    config)
-   Scrolling past the end or beginning in list menus is broken
-   When switching to the config list, start with the current config selected.
-   what we're seeing when we timeout on rak (before our time):
    xxx time is 1602024441.676982 waiting until 1602025041.6769772
    xxx timed out at 1602196977.9232273
    What is clearly happening here is that we're getting an NTP sync while
    we're waiting for rak!
-   state vectors
-   investigate https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host
-   UI
